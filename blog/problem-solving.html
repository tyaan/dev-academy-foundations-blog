        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

        <h3 style="color: red">A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>

        <h4>The problem</h4>
        <p>
          A problem I got blocked on was the task where I had to create a
          function that would calculate the average of a list of numbers. I
          understood the basic mechanics of this - add all numbers together and
          then divide by the number of numbers - but I was unsure about the most
          efficient way to do this in javascript.
        </p>
        <h4>The problem solving technique used</h4>
        <p>I started by writing pseudocode.</p>
        <ol style="text-align: left">
          <li>Create a variable called sum and set it to equal 0</li>
          <li>
            Loop through all numbers in the list and add each one of them to the
            sum variable
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the sum variable and divide it by the number of numbers in the
            list
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          After implementing this, I wanted to see if there was a better, more
          efficient way to do this using javascript, so I google searched "stack
          overflow how to find the average of a list of numbers in JS", to see
          other solutions. Stack Overflow is a great resource for learning code,
          and often has direct solutions to common problems like this one. It
          turns out there was indeed a way to do this in one line of code using
          a method that adds all elements in the list of numbers together in one
          go and then divides by the length of the list of numbers.
        </p>
        <h4>How I felt throughout the process</h4>
        <p>
          I enjoyed this process, and it made me feel good to learn a new
          javascript method and a more efficient way of doing things.
        </p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>
          I learned about the array.reduce() method in javascript, which can be
          used to perform any operation, like addition or subtraction across all
          elements in an array/list of numbers in one go.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: red">A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>

        <h4>The problem</h4>
        <p>
          A problem I solved elegantly was the super flip flop problem. In this
          problem I had to find a way to apply a function - the flip flip
          function - to all elements in an array in one go.
        </p>
        <h4>The problem solving technique used</h4>
        <p>
          During this problem, I used the rubber ducky method. The rubber ducky
          method just simply involves speaking the problem outloud to yourself,
          as if you are talking to a rubber ducky. I was a little confused at
          first, but speaking the problem out loud made it more clear. "I need
          to map all elements in this array to their flip flopped version". This
          simple sentence reminded me of the array.map method, which is designed
          for the exact purpose of applying some function to every element in an
          array.
        </p>
        <h4>How I felt throughout the process</h4>
        <p>
          I felt excited because I thought the problem would be much more
          complex, but after speaking it out loud, I realised it was just one
          line of code.
        </p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>
          I learned that speaking a problem aloud can make it clearer, and
          easier to see exactly what steps you need to take.
        </p>

        <h3 style="color: red">Reflecting on problem solving techniques</h3>

        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
        <p>
          I feel confident writing pseudocode. I have found it particularly
          useful for logical problems like the one mentioned above where I had
          to find the average of a list of numbers. It is a lot easier to layout
          the steps you need to take when you don't also have to get the code
          syntax correct. Pseudocode is a great way of breaking a problem into
          chunks and understanding the logic before implementing it.
        </p>
        <h4>Trying something</h4>
        <p>
          Trying something is a method I possibly use too much. I think I have a
          tendency to want to just work things out on my own fast, so if
          something isn't working I'll try different ways of writing it,
          different kinds of brackets etc. and just see if it works. I don't
          think this is the best way to approach things especially when you are
          learning new coding syntax. It is often faster to just google the
          solution to the problem.
        </p>
        <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
        <p>
          During this weeks work I found the rubber ducky method very useful.
          There is something about speaking out loud that helps to clarify
          thoughts and break down a problem. It can give you the benefits of
          bouncing ideas off another person, all on your own.
        </p>
        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
        <p>
          This method has proven very useful when something isn't working when I
          feel like it should be working. Often times I find that I am actually
          solving the problem correctly, but I have just missed a bracket or a
          quotation or something that is making the code fail to execute. This
          can save a lot of time that might have been spent trying to rework a
          problem that was actually already correctly solved.
        </p>
        <h4>Console.loggging</h4>
        <p>
          I have used console logging many times when I can't work out why my
          solution to a problem is not working. I will usually use console
          logging to check that values of variables during each stage of a
          solution. For example, if I was solving the problem mentioned above
          where I had to find the average of a list of numbers, and it wasn't
          working, I would first add the numbers all together and console log
          the value, before diving that value by the number of numbers. This
          would help me manually check that the addition part is working
          correctly, so I know for sure that that is not the issue witht the
          solution, and it must be something else.
        </p>
        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <p>
          Googling solutions (usually found on stack overflow) is something that
          I used frequently during these challenges. Stack overflow is a really
          incredible resource, and I was often able to find direct solutions to
          problems, or helpful javascript tips by asking questions to google
          like - "Alternatives to Object.value dot notation to access keys", or
          "How does array.reduce work".
        </p>
        <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
        <p>
          This is not something I have needed to do yet. I'm sure during the
          bootcamp I will use this technique a lot more, as I will be less
          isolated, and interacting with people more of the time.
        </p>
        <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
        <p>
          I have also used this technique pretty minimally. Often times I have
          found that asking a coach for an explanation on something usually ends
          up taking longer than just googling it.
        </p>
        <h4>Improving my process with reflection.</h4>
        <p>
          During the writing of this post, I have enjoyed reflecting on my
          problem solving process and techniques used. I think this has helped
          me solidify all the tools available to me, and I will be faster to
          choose the right tool for a problem in future.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: red">
          Reflecting on a time I was reluctant to ask for help
        </h3>
        <p>
          I found myself reluctant to ask for help during the javascript kata
          challenges because I wanted to be able to solve everything on my own.
          I don't think this was necessarily a bad thing in this situation,
          because it helped me practice my own problem solving techniques, like
          pseudocode, and look for help on the internet. I think the tendency to
          want to solve everything by myself can go to far though, and I will
          remind myself in future that if I get stuck for more than 20 minutes
          or so, its probably time to ask for some help.
