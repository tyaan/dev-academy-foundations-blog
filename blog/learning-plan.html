        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to work in senior roles as a software developer.
          I am now considering looking at game development after bootcamp. I
          always thought that would be fun, and after talking with one of the
          facilitators who works in game design, it feels like it would be
          achievable. I think that if I build solid programming foundation
          during dev academy, and then spend some time learning Unity and make a
          small game or 2, I might be able to get a junior role as a game
          developer in Wellington.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think my biggest strength will probably be my comfortability with
          self-learning new tech stuff. I think I am quite used to the
          google/stack overflow/chat gpt method of learning at this point. This
          hasn't really changed since foundations, I think I have a good
          understanding of learning styles that work for me. <br />
          I think my biggest limitation will probably be all the non-technical
          writing, its just not something I'm super comfortable with. This also
          hasn't really changed since foundations, all of this writing about how
          I'm feeling does not come naturally to me.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think I might struggle a little bit with the pair programming
          depending on who I am partnered with. I like doing things by myself,
          so I think it might be hard to share a project with one other person.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to improve my social skills and ability to connect with
          different people. It would be nice to make some friends and practice
          working on projects with one or two other people and feel comfortable
          sharing ideas and work with them.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>
          I expect the bootcamp team to provide reasonably regular support when
          I get stuck on things. I also expect semi-regular check ins to make
          sure I am feeling ok about the work and not overwhelmed. I am also
          trusting them to ensure that I come out of bootcamp with the skills
          required to get a job, assuming that I am motivated to learn during
          bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          I will seek help during bootcamp if I am stuck on something technical
          for more than 20 minutes ish. I will also seek help if I am starting
          to feel overwhelmed and worried that I won't be able to finish
          something on time. <br />
          I am committing to completely focus on dev academy from 9 - 5 every
          weekday during bootcamp, with 2 - 3 days per week on campus. I will
          also assess my workload and work on Saturdays also if I need to. I
          think if I consistently focus on dev academny during these hours and
          rest outside of these hours, I will probably be ok. <br />
          I am also committing to treating students and facilitators with
          respect, and being open to resolving any issues that might come up.
        </p>

        <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal is to establish a stable career as either a software
          developer or data scientist. I would like to aim for senior roles
          within 5 years of starting full time work.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h3>
        <p>
          Strengths: I think I have a good understanding of my learning style,
          as I have done quite a lot of self directed learning in tech and also
          music. I know that I learn best by just doing projects that require
          more knowledge than I have, and working things out along the way. I
          can also just read books/articles and retain information reasonably
          well but I think I’m a little on the ADHD end of things and have to
          focus in bursts and take breaks often, and maybe be doing something
          else at the same time for that to work. <br />
          Weaknesses: I have a tendency to get irritated by exercises that feel
          like they are a bit of a waste of time, and try to skip over them,
          like ones where you reflect on what you’ve learned and stuff like
          that. But I think in reality these are actually good for solidifying
          knowledge, I don’t retain stuff super well by rushing through it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I would like to get better at collaborating with other people without
          trying to control everything. I'm also hoping to develop more patience
          in learning, and resist the urge to want to rush through things.
        </p>
        <h3>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </h3>
        <p>
          I will always try to stay aware of other people’s emotions, and ensure
          that I treat everyone with respect. I will always treat the
          facilitators with respect and try to remind myself that they are also
          people just trying to help and it’s not their fault if something
          doesn’t make sense.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </h3>
        <p>
          When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will try and
          take breaks and do something else for a day or a few hours (or just
          however much time I can realistically take away from the course).
          Exercise, playing music, and walks in the bush are good things for me
          to do to reset.
        </p>
        <h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3>
        <p>
          If I am struggling with something technical, I’ll give it at least a
          couple of tries myself to try and work it out, but will reach out to
          facilitators if it’s getting to the point where I am spending too much
          time trying to solve a problem on my own. I’ll try not to spend more
          than a few hours on anything before asking a question. If I need
          emotional help, I’ll probably just go to a friend outside the course,
          but I also might talk to other students and see if they are feeling
          the same way.
        </p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
        <p>
          I expect a reasonable level of support from the facilitators to help
          me past anything I get stuck on. I figure there are more students than
          facilitators so they won’t be able to help everyone all the time, so
          I’ll do my best to work things out on my own first, and ask for help
          when I really need it.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Wellington Jazz Festival is 16 - 20 October, and is the only fixed
          commitment I have during the course. I have a few different gigs
          planned in that week, so I think that week will likely be a bit
          hectic. I’ll try and see if there is anything I can get done in
          advance in the weeks leading up to that.
