      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Around age 19 I decided to start being vegetarian, and eventually vegan.
        The decision kind of started from questioning why people eat cows but
        not dogs. I thought a lot about possible reasons that a dog’s life might
        be more valuable than a cow, or more generally, if there is some
        difference between animals that makes it more morally acceptable to kill
        some animals than others, and what that difference might be. The
        conclusion was basically that there really isn’t any feature of any
        animal that makes its life more or less valuable, except maybe like
        depth of suffering, but that is a very difficult thing to define. I
        could say a lot more… but I’m sure a deep dive on the philosophy of
        veganism probably isn’t necessary here. <br />
        I reflect on this decision positively nowadays. It took some time to
        learn about nutrition and work out whether you can actually live plant
        based without your health deteriorating, but I’m now confident that it’s
        possible, and happy to be able to live my life without eating animals.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I grew up with my mum and my brother, and I think my mum was quite a
        caring and relatively progressive person, so I grew up with pretty
        left-wing values. As I got older, the people I have spent the most time
        with are people around my age, which is somewhere between millennials
        and gen z, generally on the left end of the political spectrum. My
        generation has a particular focus on equality across the sexuality
        spectrum, so that is something that I now consider a lot more than I did
        growing up. I think my generation has also developed much more awareness
        of Māori values, and how to relate to them as a pākeha, which is also
        something that I also didn’t consider as much growing up. <br />
        I have also spent a lot of time as a musician, particularly as a jazz
        musician, which I think has influenced my values. There is a pretty
        strong focus within jazz musicians on authenticity, openness, and
        developing good relationships with other musicians. There is also a very
        strong focus on basically practicing as much as possible, which is
        arguably unhealthy, but I think it did teach me to work quite hard
        pretty early on in life, which in retrospect was quite a good thing to
        do.

      <h3>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think my best strength is anything in the realm of math. I love math,
        all of my favourite parts of my degree were the math parts. I also think
        that the combination of math and music that I have done has helped me to
        develop a strong creative problem solving ability. I think it’s unlikely
        I will have trouble learning anything because of its technical
        complexity. <br />
        I think I also have a reasonably good understanding of learning styles
        that work for me. I know that I learn best by just doing projects and
        learning what I need to learn as I go. I find it harder to just sit and
        read and retain information, so I will try and avoid this type of
        learning where possible.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think sometimes I tend to want to get things done fast and end up not
        really learning them properly, or retaining information properly. I
        think taking this course and following a structured learning plan might
        help me get better at that.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of my friends used to play in a band I was running, but I kept
        getting the impression that he didn’t really want to be there, and I
        also know he kind of struggles with saying no to people, so I starting
        thinking maybe he just said yes because he felt like he had to but he
        didn’t really want to be there. This created a lot of tension, because
        we kind of ended up in a bad place where I would ask him to learn stuff
        for rehearsal, and he wouldn’t really do it, because he wasn’t really
        interested, but he would show up anyway, and then I would get annoyed at
        him for not doing as much as the other people in the band were doing,
        and he would get annoyed at me for asking too much from him. <br />
        In the end I just sent him a message essentially saying that it’s
        completely ok if he doesn’t want to be a part of this project, but I
        need to know if that is the case, because I will find someone else who
        is keen. It was sort of effective. He just didn’t respond to the message
        at all, and I found someone else to take his place. I’m not sure what I
        could have done better, I still feel like complete openness is better in
        situations like that. It possibly might have been better to put less
        pressure on him, and just trust my feeling that he wasn’t interested,
        and just tell him that I really appreciate the work that he put in so
        far, but I’m going to get someone else involved, rather than trying to
        directly ask him if he wants to be there when I know that he isn't
        comfortable giving people a direct no.
