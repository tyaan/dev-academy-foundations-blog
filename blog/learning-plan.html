      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to establish a stable career as either a software
        developer or data scientist. I would like to aim for senior roles within
        5 years of starting full time work.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        Strengths: I think I have a good understanding of my learning style, as
        I have done quite a lot of self directed learning in tech and also
        music. I know that I learn best by just doing projects that require more
        knowledge than I have, and working things out along the way. I can also
        just read books/articles and retain information reasonably well but I
        think I’m a little on the ADHD end of things and have to focus in bursts
        and take breaks often, and maybe be doing something else at the same
        time for that to work. <br />
        Weaknesses: I have a tendency to get irritated by exercises that feel
        like they are a bit of a waste of time, and try to skip over them, like
        ones where you reflect on what you’ve learned and stuff like that. But I
        think in reality these are actually good for solidifying knowledge, I
        don’t retain stuff super well by rushing through it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I would like to get better at collaborating with other people without
        trying to control everything. I'm also hoping to develop more patience
        in learning, and resist the urge to want to rush through things.
      </p>
      <h3>
        An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and
        safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
        representatives
      </h3>
      <p>
        I will always try to stay aware of other people’s emotions, and ensure
        that I treat everyone with respect. I will always treat the facilitators
        with respect and try to remind myself that they are also people just
        trying to help and it’s not their fault if something doesn’t make sense.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      </h3>
      <p>
        When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will try and
        take breaks and do something else for a day or a few hours (or just
        however much time I can realistically take away from the course).
        Exercise, playing music, and walks in the bush are good things for me to
        do to reset.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        If I am struggling with something technical, I’ll give it at least a
        couple of tries myself to try and work it out, but will reach out to
        facilitators if it’s getting to the point where I am spending too much
        time trying to solve a problem on my own. I’ll try not to spend more
        than a few hours on anything before asking a question. If I need
        emotional help, I’ll probably just go to a friend outside the course,
        but I also might talk to other students and see if they are feeling the
        same way.
      </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        I expect a reasonable level of support from the facilitators to help me
        past anything I get stuck on. I figure there are more students than
        facilitators so they won’t be able to help everyone all the time, so
        I’ll do my best to work things out on my own first, and ask for help
        when I really need it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Wellington Jazz Festival is 16 - 20 October, and is the only fixed
        commitment I have during the course. I have a few different gigs planned
        in that week, so I think that week will likely be a bit hectic. I’ll try
        and see if there is anything I can get done in advance in the weeks
        leading up to that.
