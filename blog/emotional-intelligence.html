        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold">What is emotional intelligence?</span>
          Emotional intelligence can mean many things. For me, emotional
          intelligence is about reading peoples expressions, deducing the
          emotional motivations behind others behaviour, feeling empathy, and
          understanding my own internal emotions and resulting behaviours. There
          can be a lot of overlap between each of these things. For example,
          reading peoples expressions is easier if you feel empathy, and your
          own internal emotional state matches whatever expression you see on a
          person in front of you, and understanding your own internal emotions
          and behaviours can help to deduce the emotional motivations of others
          behaviour.

            >What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</span
          >
          EQ and IQ, meaning emotional quotient and intelligence quotient, refer
          to a persons level of emotional and intellectual intelligence. IQ
          seems to usually measured by a persons ability to solve complex
          problems using reason and logic and intuit underlying patterns in
          complex systems, whereas emotional intelligence is more defined by the
          empathetic skills mentioned above. There is a lot of debate around
          whether IQ and EQ can be accurately measured because there are so many
          factors. Tests would need to take into account cultural differences,
          and not focus too much on specific topics or types of problems that
          some people may be better trained in. Creating a test that generalizes
          to every person in the world and gives an accurate measure of IQ or EQ
          is very difficult, and I personally think assigning general
          intelligence values to people is silly, and can be dangerous if the
          tests are biased towards specific cultures or types of intelligence.

          >
          Developing stronger emotional intelligence can help you gain control
          over your own behaviour and emotional state, improve your well-being,
          work better with others, form stronger emotional connections with
          others, and help others improve their own emotional well-being.

            >How to improve emotional intelligence and emotional
            well-being?</span
          >
          Practices that improve emotional intelligence include meditation and
          various mindfulness practices, among many others. The world of
          emotional intelligence practices is vast and complex, with entire
          academic fields dedicated to understanding human emotions and
          psychology and developing theraputic tools and practices to improve
          emotional well-being. Practices like meditation are easy for anyone to
          do and are proven to improve well-being to some extent by relaxing the
          nervous system and bringing emotion and thought processes more into
          the concious mind. However, improving well-being by making changes to
          patterns of behaviour and emotions and underlying perceptions about
          yourself, others, and the world, generally can be a significantly more
          complicated task, which can require very different things for
          different people. In my experience, emotional well-being can be hugely
          improved by just getting more physical excercise, dedicating more time
          to things I enjoy, and making an effort to develop close friendships.
          Practices like meditation and mindfulness can be a good step in
          developing the emotional intelligence required to understand yourself,
          so that you can work out what it is that you really need.
