        <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
          due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>

        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>

        <h3>
          What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>

        <p>
          I feel like it helped me feel more relaxed about my plan for the
          future. The whole growth mindset thing makes a lot of sense. Rather
          than stressing about achieving some specific goal, and feeling like
          your life won't be good until you get there, it feels a lot better to
          just accept wherever you are now and make your goal always to just be
          better.
        </p>

        <h3>
          What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h3>

        <p>
          Doing a lot of writing was quite challenging, I haven't done much
          writing probably since high school. I did some in university, but that
          was mostly like lab reports. Just writing my thoughts and feelings was
          not something I am used to at all.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course?
        </h3>

        <p>
          I have heard that most tech employers value your attitude as much as
          your technical skills. This makes sense considering that most jobs
          will probably have you doing specific things that you might need to
          learn once you start the job anyway, so they would want to just look
          for people that are motivated, can work in a team, and solve problems
          well by themselves. Emotional well-being also plays a huge part in
          your ability to be productive and engage your problem solving ability,
          so it makes sense to focus in on that.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like
          a waste of time?
        </h3>

        <p>
          No it doesn't feel like a waste of time. A couple of the excercises
          felt like a bit too much, like almost a little bit condescending
          because of how they were almost treating me like a child becoming
          aware of emotions for the first time. But I understand why its
          important, and some of the excercises were actually very helpful.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
          Justify your answer.
        </h3>

        <p>
          No I don't think so. The programming stuff has been fine, it was
          helpful to do the human skills along side it to get constant reminders
          to check in with how I am feeling and how I am approaching solving
          problems. I think it helped to solidify the mindset that I should be
          in when programming in future.
