        <h3>
          Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Many people are told early on in life that they are smart or dumb, or
          particularly good at some things and bad at others. For example, take
          someone who believes they are “bad at math”. Maybe they were told that
          once by a teacher, or maybe a particular learning style didn’t work
          for them at some point, and they struggled more than other students,
          and internalized the belief that they just aren’t good at math.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding neuroplasticity can help remind people that there is no
          good or bad or smart or dumb, there is just people who have built the
          neural pathways to do particular tasks, and people who haven’t built
          those pathways. When you understand this, you can shake off the belief
          that your abilities or intelligence is fixed, and know that all you
          need to do to learn something is find a learning style that works for
          you, and practice it consistently over time to build those neural
          pathways.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
          for your benefit.
        </h3>
        <p>
          The principles of neuroplasticity outline a range of rules explaining
          what types of practice and training are most effective for learning
          new things. They mostly focus on the idea that repetition strengthens
          and maintains neural pathways, which will decay when unused. They also
          say that intensity matters, and you can form stronger neural pathways
          by practicing something at a high intensity. I have found in my own
          life that a good way to learn new things and develop knowledge in an
          area is not to learn slowly and consistently over time, but to study
          very intensely for short periods with longer periods in between where
          you continue to use the skill a moderate amount, and let the knowledge
          and muscle memory sink in before adding more new information. I think
          this is the approach I will continue to take when it comes to learning
          coding and other tech skills.

        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Activities that increase neuroplasticity include: playing video games,
          learning languages, making music and traveling. Things that increase
          neuroplasticity in general seem to usually either involve some new
          type of stimulus (like traveling to new places), some type of creative
          problem solving (like in video games and making music), or making new
          connections between things (like learning languages).

        <h1 style="color: red">Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset is the idea that your goal with any activity should
          simply be growth, rather than any particular achievement. It can be a
          helpful way of thinking to reduce lack of motivation after a goal is
          achieved, issues with comparing yourself with others and negative self
          beliefs around abilities and intelligence. With a growth mindset you
          only ever need to compare yourself to yourself, and your goal at all
          times is to be a better version of yourself. A growth mindset is
          related to neuroplasticity in that it acknowledges that whatever you
          have achieved and wherever you are currently at in life, you can
          always grow and learn and change more, and there is no reason to
          assume your abilities have a ceiling, or set fixed and final life
          goals for anything.
        </p>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
        <p>
          This exploration reminded me to stop comparing myself to other people,
          and just focus on where I am at and what I can do to improve.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think I have somewhat anxiously set myself limits on what I could
          achieve within tech. After discussing neuroplasticity and growth
          mindset I think it might be better to set goals around building solid
          health and learning habits, rather than achieving some particular
          thing, like getting a specific type of job or anything. I’m sure the
          learning will continue even after that.

          Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
          your learning plan and strategy.
        </h3>
        <p>
          After considering neuroplasticity and growth mindset, I think that my
          learning journey should be more focussed on building strong and
          healthy habits, rather than achieving a particular goal. I would also
          like to stop comparing myself to others so much, and not let others
          achievements affect my self worth or goal setting.
