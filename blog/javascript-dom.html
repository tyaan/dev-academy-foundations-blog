        <h1>Javascript DOM</h1>
        <p>
          Javascript controls the logic and mechanics behind content you see on
          a page. While HTML defines the content, and CSS defines the style of
          the content, javascript defines anything the moves, changes, or reacts
          to user input. Javascript can add, remove and edit the HTML and CSS of
          a page in response with changes defined by sets of logical rules, or
          in response to events from the user.
        </p>
        <h3>
          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
        </h3>
        <p>
          If a web page were a movie, javascript would be the director. HTML is
          like the script of the movie, the raw content with no visual styling.
          CSS is what makes it pretty, like set designers, costume designers and
          cinematographers. A director brings everything together, directing
          actors to move around, sets to be shifted, and cinematographers to
          move their shots. When you watch the movie, you don't directly see the
          director working, but behind the scenes, all of the elements are
          controlled by them.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
          life
        </h3>
        <p>
          Control flow describes the order with which the computer will read and
          process code. This is not always linear, as the use of statements like
          if, while and for, define instructions for when to skip over parts of
          code, or loop parts of code multiple times. Its kind of like if you
          wrote yourself a schedule for your day and included things like "if
          you finish work early, go to the gym", or "work on this project until
          you get a call from your friend to pick you up". You control the flow
          by determining when and how many times each task (or pice of code)
          will be performed, and conditions for starting or ending a task.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it
        </h3>
        <p>
          The DOM or Document Object Model, is a framework that breaks each part
          of an HTML document up into chunks, each one assignable with class and
          id names. These chunks or "objects" can be referenced by their class
          or id names using javascript, to be added, edited and removed
          dynamically.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
        </h3>
        <p>
          An object is simply a reference to a single value. In javascript, and
          object is defined by giving it a name, and a value using the
          <code>let name = value</code> syntax. To access an object after it has
          been defined, you simply use its name which will return its value. An
          array is like a list of objects, with numbered positions in the list.
          New arrays are defined using the
          <code>let arr = ['value 1', 'value 2', 'value 3']</code> syntax. To
          access a particular object from an array of objects after it has been
          defined, the position or index of the object needs to be referenced
          using the <code>array[index]</code> syntax.
        </p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are chunks of code that take some input variables, perform
          some actions and return some output variables. In some cases, they can
          just perform some actions, and do not need to take any input variables
          or return any output. After a function is defined, its code can be
          executed simply by calling the function name, and passing it some
          input variables. This is useful as it allows you to easily repeat
          chunks of code that are needed multiple times, or some logic that
          needs to be repeated multiple times with different inputs.
